           <h3>Device and System Data types</h3>
               <p>
                The application may collect basic, non-personal technical information such as device model, operating system version, and anonymised usage statistics or error logs. This information is used solely to monitor performance, improve reliability, and ensure compatibility across different mobile devices and environments. 
               </p>

          <h3>Device Data Collection & Storage</h3>
            <p> 
             When interacting with the application, user-entered data is processed temporarily within secure in-memory structures. These values remain available only while the application session is active. Once the app is closed or refreshed, the information is cleared unless the user deliberately enables persistent storage features. No personal or sensitive data is uploaded to external servers, and the app only communicates with remote endpoints when necessary (e.g., retrieving sample data). Location data and unrelated identifying information are never collected or transmitted.

          <h3>Storage Method</h3>
              <p>
              All information entered into the application is provided voluntarily by the user. This data is held temporarily in the browser’s memory or local state management system and is cleared automatically when the app is refreshed or closed. Some cached values may remain available for short periods if required for normal functionality, but no long-term or server-side storage occurs unless explicitly indicated.

          <h3>Security Risks</h3>
            <p>
            <li>Potential risks associated with the app include:</li>
            <li>- of incorrect data entry without validation.</li>
            <li>- Risk of someone using the device seeing or modifying inventory items.</li>
            <li>- If using API: risks in data transmission (e.g., interception) if not protected.</li>
            <li>- Risks of weak identifiers (if item names are not unique).</li>
            <li>- Local session-based data can be lost, altered, or viewed by others using the same device.</li> 
            </p>
          </ion-label>
      </ion-item>


    <!-- //Security Controls-->

        <ion-label>
          <h3>Security Controls</h3>
          <p>
           <li>To reduce risks, several safeguards are implemented:</li> 
           <li> - Input validation (required fields, numeric checks, unique ID logic).</li>
           <li> - Restricted modification: items can only be edited or deleted by name.Use of HTTPS (API endpoint is HTTPS)</li> 
           <li> - Clear warnings and confirmation dialogs (delete confirmation).</li>
           <li>- No sensitive data stored, reducing overall privacy impact.Separation between UI and data logic (clean architecture reduces errors).</li> 
          </p> 
        </ion-label>
